# Chapter 1 Introduction

+ What is testing?
    1. find defects in a controlled manner(Product): find the problems
    2. detecting the level of quality of the test object
    3. find the gap between specification and the actual product
    4. **Note:** If a test finds few or no failures, confidence in the product will increase
+ What is software testing?
    1. software testing is the process of executing software in a controlled manner, in order to answer the question "Does the software behave as specified?"
    2. software testing is often used
+ Why do we test?
    1. information for stakeholders
    2. find bugs
    3. give confidence
    4. mitigate risk
    5. measure quality
    6. enums software is fit for purpose
+ What do we test?
    1. application software
    2. hardware
    3. system software
    4. procedures
    5. documentation
    6. functionality
    7. performance
    8. usability
+ Who does the testing?
    1. software testing is not a one person job
    2. it takes a team, but the team may be larger or smaller depending on the size and complexity of the application being tested
    3. the programmer(s) who wrote the application should have a reduced role in the testing if possible
+ Who's involved in testing?
    1. developers
    2. testers
    3. trainers
    4. users
    5. project managers
    6. everybody is responsibly for quality
+ Why software testing is important?
    1. all software has defects
    2. all software products are 'prototypes'
    3. software products are getting larger and more complicated
    4. software is written by human-human make mistakes
    5. software testing looks to find the most important defect as early as possible-increasing confidence that the software meets specification
