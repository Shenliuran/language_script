# Chapter 1

+ UML --> Unified Modeling Language
    1. Unified: unique language to create the model
    2. language: It is not a C, C++ language only for modeling

+ Title and Content
    1. Introduction
        1. Building blocks of UML
            1. Things:
                1. structural things
                2. behavioral things
                3. grouping things
                4. annotational things
            2. Relationships:
                1. association
                2. generalization
                3. dependency
            3. Diagram (Six Diagram):
                1. class diagram
                2. object diagram
                3. state diagram
                4. activity diagram
                5. use case diagram
                6. sequence diagram
        2. Who is the father of UML?
            1. Grady Booch --> **Boochmethod**
            2. Ivar Jacobson --> **OOSE**
            3. James Rumbaugh --> **OMT(Object Modeling Technique)**
        3. When? **1990's**
        4. Where can the UML be used?
            1. Transportation -- Airplane
            2. Defence / Aerospace
            3. Retail
            4. Medical Electronics
            5. Bank and Financial services
            6. Telecommunications
            7. Enterprise Information systems

    2. History of UML
        1. In 1997 UML was adopted by OMG
        2. In 2000 UML
    3. What is UML?</br>
        The UML is a language for</br>
        1. visualizing
        2. specifying: build a model, precise, unmanning complete
        3. constructing: mapping (outline) between UML and Java, C++, Visual Basic
        4. documenting Design do

    4. Model
        1. Why do we model? --> We can better understand the system we are developing
        2. Advantages of Model
            1. Visualizing the system
            2. Help to specifying the constructional and behavioral fo system
            3. Make template of construction of system
            4. Documenting the system
        3. Simplification fo reality something in the real world

    5. Modeling
        1. is a proven and well-accepted engineering technique which help build a model
        2. blue print of actual system

+ Building Block of UML
    1. Things   (important modeling concept)
        1. Structural   (**static** part of model)
            1. class: collection of object
            2. use case: sequence of action
            3. node: physical element that exist at run time
            4. component: physical part of the system that holds information
            5. collaboration: interaction between elements
        2. Behavioral  (**dynamic** part of model)
            1. interaction: group of message exchange among element
            2. state machine -- ON/OFF
        3. Grouping
            1.package
        4. Annotational
            1. note: formal and informal text
    2. Relationship  (tying individual things)
        1. Association:</br>**has a** Relationship</br>symbol: ![avatar](../images/UML/关联.png)
            1. Aggregation:</br>symbol: ![avatar](../images/UML/聚合.png)
            2. Composition:</br>symbol: ![avatar](../images/UML/组合.png)
        2. Generalization:</br>**parent--child** relationship</br>symbol: ![avatar](../images/UML/泛化.png)</br>**is a(an) kind of** relationship
        3. Dependency:</br>symbol: ![avatar](../images/UML/依赖.png)</br>depends on something
    3. Diagram:  (collection of things and relationship)
        1. Structural   (**static** view)
            1. class diagram
            2. object diagram
        2. Behavioral   (**dynamic view)
            1. use case diagram
            2. activity diagram
            3. sequence diagram
