# Chapter 2 Principles of Software Testing

+ Testing important concept
    1. error / mistakes
        1. a mistake in coding is called error (mistakes made by software developers, human's mistake)
    2. faults
    3. defect
        1. error found by tester is called defect (incorrect step, process or data definition in computer program)
    4. failures
        1. build(Product) does not meet the requirements then it is failure
        2. in other words defect is the difference between expected and actual result in the context of testing
    5. debug
        1. defect accepted by development team then it is called bug
        2. debugging is the process of finding and resolving of defects or problem within the program that prevent correct
    6. verification and validation
        1. software testing is just one kind of verification
        2. validation is the process of checking that what has
    7. test case
        1. is a set of conditions under which a tester will determine whether an application is working correctly or not
+ Type of testing:
    1. manual testing
    2. automation testing
+ Level of testing
    1. unit testing (chapter 3)
    2. integrate testing (chapter 6)
    3. system testing (chapter 7)
    4. UAT (chapter 7)
+ Software faults
    1. algorithms faults:</br>when unit of the software does ont produce an output corresponding to the given input under the designated algorithms
    2. Syntax faults:</br>source code is not in conformance to the programming language
    3. documentation faults:</br>the system fails to operate correctly when the applied load exceeds the specified maximum for the system
    4. capacity and boundary faults:</br>the system fails to operate correct when data stores are filled beyond their capacity
+ Software quality</br>According the ISO/IEC Standard, software quality comprises the following factors:
    1. functionality
    2. reliability
    3. usability
    4. efficiency
    5. maintainability
    6. portability
+ Need for testing
+ Dynamic
